The following directory contains python code using django framework to build a basic web application. This is a very simple app that displays some of my favourite songs (I picked them randomly). The template is written in HTML and the webapp was built with Python Django. The dependecy files generated from django are also present (Pipfile, Pipfile.lock).

Finally the Docker file to create an image from this webapp is also inside this directory.
